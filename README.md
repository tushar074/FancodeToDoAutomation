# FancodeAutomation  
API Automation Framework:

This project automates the verification of user tasks using Rest Assured and TestNG. The scenario involves checking that all users from the city FanCode have completed more than 50% of their todo tasks.

# Scenario:    
All the users of City `FanCode` should have more than half of their todos task completed  
   Given: User has todo tasks  
   And: User belongs to the city FanCode  
   Then: User's completed task percentage should be greater than 50%  
   
`FanCode` city can be identified by latitude between -40 to 5 and longitude between 5 to 100 in the users API.
